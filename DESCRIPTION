Description: Tool to assessing whether the results of a study could be influenced by
    collinearity. Simulations under a given hypothesized truth regarding effects of an
    exposure on the outcome are used and the resulting curves of lagged effects are
    visualized. A user's manual is provided, which includes detailed examples (e.g. a
    cohort study looking for windows of vulnerability to air pollution, a time series
    study examining the linear association of air pollution with hospital admissions,
    and a time series study examining the non-linear association between temperature and
    mortality). The methods are described in Basagana and Barrera-Gomez (2021) <doi:10.1093/ije/dyab179>.
